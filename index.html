<p>Hi! My name is David Valverde, I am a Computer Science Major and Freshman here as BYUI. I'm a mix of an indoor and outdoor person, so as much as I love playing videos games and sketching, I also love to be in the outdoors and hike.  </p>
<p>My Favorite Scripture is D&C 121:45 Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.</p>
<p>46 The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever.</p>
